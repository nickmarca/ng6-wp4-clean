# ng6-wp4-clean
This a Angular 6 and Webpack 4 clean starter template

### Install ### 

1. Git clone this repo
2. Run "npm install" into repo folder
3. Run "npm run dev"

### Why ###

This project is a clean Angular starter template who I plan to maintain as long as I use Angular at my Job.

The reason why I decided to create this is because I want to have a clean, not opinated and light alternative to Angular Cli.

This is not suppose to do all the things Angular CLI does but it is suppose to do the *main* job Angular CLI does that is transpile Angular Typescript code.
